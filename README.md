# Package License Transfer Service for Salesforce

## Overview
The PackageLicenseTransferService is a Salesforce Apex class that helps manage and transfer installed package licenses between users. It's particularly useful when you need to:
- Automatically reassign licenses from inactive or infrequent users
- Transfer licenses to new team members
- Revert license assignments to previous holders
- Manage licenses for packages like SDOC, CONGA, or other installed packages

## Features
- üîÑ Automatic transfer of package licenses
- üë§ Smart selection of source users based on last login date
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Revert capability to restore previous license assignments
- ‚ö° Invocable from Flow Builder
- üõ°Ô∏è Built-in validation and error handling
- üì¶ Support for any installed package

## How It Works

### Basic License Transfer
The service finds the user with the oldest last login date who currently has the specified package license and transfers it to the designated new user.

### Revert Operation
You can revert a previous transfer by specifying the current license holder and the user who should get their license back.

## Usage in Flow Builder

### New Transfer
1. Add an Action element to your flow
2. Select "Transfer Package License"
3. Configure the following required fields:
   - New User ID
   - Package Namespace (e.g., "SDOC")
   - Is Revert Operation (set to false)

### Revert Transfer
1. Add an Action element to your flow
2. Select "Transfer Package License"
3. Configure the following fields:
   - New User ID (the user getting their license back)
   - Current Holder ID (the user who currently has the license)
   - Package Namespace
   - Is Revert Operation (set to true)

## Input Parameters

## Error Handling
The service includes comprehensive error handling for common scenarios:

- Database operation failures

## Installation
Deploy the following components to your Salesforce org:
1. PackageLicenseTransferService.cls
2. PackageLicenseTransferServiceTest.cls

## Best Practices
- Always test the service with a small subset of users first
- Keep track of license transfers for audit purposes
- Consider implementing additional security measures in your flow
- Monitor debug logs for detailed operation information

## Limitations
